  <summary>:us: 2020-21</summary>

  - List all the differences between SVM and NN (without actually explaining _what_ they are)
  - Explain why SOMs are better than K-Means
  - RBF kernel (especially from the point of view of the LBE)
  - Approximation theorem of NNs

</details>
<details>
  <summary>:us: 2019-20</summary>

- Write the loss for a linear model in form of ridge regression (with Tikhonov regularization)
- Write (and briefly comment on) the most important factors ruling the flexibility of the SVM and of the NN approaches
Compute dE/do_i for a NN (the same seen in class) showing the single steps of the derivation for the dE/do_i (assuming to have already delta for the units of the other layers indexed by h and k. Finally, write delta_k, delta_t, delta_i
- Define the VC-dim. Does the VC-dim in Phi_1 increase or decrease if the value of the regularization parameter increases? Explain.
------------------------------
1.
- Write the net_t(x) of a preceptron with inputs i in [1, ..., k]  
- Write the radial basis function kernel

2. Answer true or false to the following and motivate your answer  
- In a SVM can the alpha values help to select the best features? False (they only select some input patterns and not the components)  
- To estimate the (future) predictive capability of your model is it a good practice to consider the result and accuracy obtained by the model selection phase without looking to the training results? False (only the test result cares to estimate the (future) predictive capability)
- Increasing the VC-dim, th VC-bound on the risk R (according to SLT) increases. True

3. Write the derivation of the bias-variance decomposition (assuming without proving the variance lemma)

4. Show a picture of:  
- undercomplete autoencoder  
- overcomplete autoencoder

5. Equation of the RBF Kernel. Equation of the Loss for Ridge regression + comments on the role of lambda.

6. Equations used for SOM. Why is the Neural Network able to approximate every function? Why do we use deep learning if one layer is enough?

## PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS: PARADIGMS AND MODELS
:it: _La maggior parte dell'orale verte sul progetto e molte delle domande di teoria sono collegate._

    <summary>:it: 2019-20</summary>

  - Macro Data Flow con esempio

  - Buildin blocks per streming e data.

  - Point to point e collective comunication in fast flow. Qunado serve collective comunication.

  - Service time, latency, efficiency più esempi su quando voglio ottimizzare cosa

  <summary>:it: 2018-19</summary>

- Perchè non hai usato un manager e hai fatto fare tutto all’emitter? Con il manager hai dei movimenti di dati in più? L’emitter ha qualche guadagno se c’è il manager?
- Perchè parti subito con un numero fissato di worker? Non sarebbe stato meglio farlo lavorare uno e poi capire quanti worker servono dinamicamente?
- Sarebbe stato giusto fare un’analisi del tempo che ci metto per fare uno switch del numero di worker in modo da capire ogni quanto cambiare
- Se ho due map quali ottimizzazioni posso fare? Se faccio la map fusion poi ho un guadagno? Ce l’ho sempre?
- Se metto una map dentro ad una farm che guadagno ho se aumento il numero di worker della map o se aumento il numero di worker della farm?
Se tolgo la map e lascio la farm aumentando i worker cambia qualcosa? L’efficiency come cambia? Se tolgo tutto e lascio solo un nodo sequenziale cambia qualcosa? L’efficiency come varia (diventa 1)?
- Differenza tra work span model e amdahl law, voleva sapere che i nodi devono avere lo stesso tempo di esecuzione
------------------------------
- Come si calcola lo speedup?
- Amdahl Law (con limite)
- Cosa devo aggiungere ad un farm che tenga in conto sia il tempo che il consumo energetico (considerando che entrambi dipendono dal nw)? Devo tenere conto di grado di parallelismo e frequenza del processore. Nel collector posso calcolare il service time Ts. Posso variare il numero di worker e vedere all'aumentare del nw come varia l'energia. Più worker = meno tempo di uso di CPU con più consumo. Posso fermarmi quando diventa sconveniente aumentare il nw per l'overhead.

  - Macro Data Flow with examples

  <summary>:us: 2018-19</summary>

- Why didn't you use a manager and have the emitter do everything? Do you have more data movements with the manager? Does the emitter have any earnings if there is a manager?
- Why do you start immediately with a fixed number of workers? Wouldn't it have been better to have him work one and then figure out how many workers they need dynamically?
- It would have been right to do an analysis of the time it takes to make a switch of the number of workers in order to understand how often to change
- If I have two maps, which optimizations can I do? If I do map fusion then do I have a profit? Do I always have it?
- If I put a map inside a farm, what profit do I have if I increase the number of workers on the map or if I increase the number of workers in the farm?
If I remove the map and leave the farm increasing the workers does something change? How does efficiency change? If I remove everything and leave only a sequential node, does something change? How does the efficiency vary (becomes 1)?
- Difference between work span model and amdahl law, he wanted to know that nodes must have the same execution time
------------------------------
- How is the speedup calculated?
- Amdahl Law (with limit)
- What should I add to a farm that takes into account both time and energy consumption (considering that both depend on the nw)? I have to take into account the degree of parallelism and the frequency of the processor. In the collector I can calculate the service time Ts. I can vary the number of workers and see how the energy changes as the nw increases. More worker = less CPU usage time with more consumption. I can stop when it becomes inconvenient to increase the nw for overhead.
- Types of patterns
